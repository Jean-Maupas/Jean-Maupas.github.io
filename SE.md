### Software Engineering

I have always been passionate about automatization and, so, building computer software was been a natural extension of my work on data. The following are examples of software related accomplishments:
 - Development and integration of Computerized Systems including EDC, phase I automation, data acquisition, CTMS, thesaurus coding, safety DB, Imaging, and randomization systems.
 - User/Business/functional requirements development and management, software design and system architecture, coding (waterfall, spiral, agile).
 - Several 21 CFR part 11 validations including writing plans and URS, GXP assessment, SDLC management, matrices, writing scenarios, protocols, cases, qualifications, validation reports.
