### Data Analysis

Analyzing clinical data came naturally during my residency. For several rotations I choose an oncology unit highly specialized in treating leukemia and lymphomas. We were collecting data for all the patients and I was performing all statistical analyses for publications and presentations. 

There was also several clinical trials for which I implemented computerized systems and performed basic statistical analysis in collaboration with some other statisticians. 

I also managed a biometrics department that was generated Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) for FDA, TPD and EMEA submissions following CDISC/SDTM & ADaM (NDA 505b1 & 505b2, and ANDA).

More recently, I was analyzing data for a small startup developing a innovative device in cardiology. We wrote several presentations and 2 papers.
