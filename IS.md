### Information Systems

I have been in charge of the computerized systems in several organizations, but the one where I spent the most of my time in Information Systems management was EORTC, where I bore the official title. 

Highlights of my responsibilities include:
 - Development and integration of Computerized Systems including EDC, phase I automation, data acquisition, CTMS, thesaurus coding, safety DB, Imaging, and randomization systems.
 - User/Business/functional requirements development and management, software design and system architecture, coding (waterfall, spiral, agile).
 - Several 21 CFR part 11 validations including writing plans and URS, GXP assessment, SDLC management, matrices, writing scenarios, protocols, cases, qualifications, validation reports.
